# CurrencyConverter
Currency converter project

Requesting data: The microservice convert.cpp once ran will ask the user if they wish to grab the data out of the file. Once the user types 1 then it will grab the data from Passer.txt

Receiving data: Convert.cpp will put the converted number into passer2.txt once it is converted. The user then clicks results in the UI and the converted number is displayed.
